Description: 
    NewsSentiment is an easy-to-use R Package that achieves 
    state-of-the-art performance for target-dependent sentiment classification
    on news articles. NewsSentiment uses the currently best performing 
    targeted sentiment classifier for news articles. 
    In contrast to regular sentiment classification, targeted sentiment 
    classification allows you to provide a target in a sentence. 
    Only for this target, the sentiment is then predicted. 
    This is more reliable in many cases, as demonstrated by the following 
    simplistic example: 	''I like Bert, but I hate Robert.''
